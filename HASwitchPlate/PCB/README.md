# PCB source files and Gerber outputs

Above you'll find [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) [schematic](https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/blob/master/PCB/HASwitchPlate.sch) and [PCB](https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/blob/master/PCB/HASwitchPlate.kicad_pcb) files along with [a ZIP bundle containing complete gerber outputs](https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/raw/master/PCB/HASwitchPlate.gerbers.zip) ready to send to [your favorite PCB shop](https://www.allpcb.com/?Mb_InviteId=34099).

I had these manufactured by [AllPCB](https://www.allpcb.com/?Mb_InviteId=34099) and I'm very happy with the results.  The quality has been perfect and their shipping time to the US has been under a week across several orders.  [If you sign up through this link](https://www.allpcb.com/?Mb_InviteId=34099)  they credit me some cash that I can use for future projects which helps me out a bit.

If you aren't looking to buy a zillion boards, I may have some ready for US orders in [my Tindie store](https://www.tindie.com/products/luma/ha-switchplate-hasp-pcb/).
